# Kind Theme for [Aigis Generator](https://github.com/pxgrid/aigis/)

Aigis Theme files for Kind, these need to be added to `styleguide/templates`which should look like this:

```
styleguide
 - build
 - templates
 - theme
```

`build` is where gulp should be building your styleguide files, these are written over with every gulp file change
`templates` is where these files (and any other theme files) should be placed, these are written over, however, a styleguide needs to be re-generated if `.ejs` files are updated. This can be done by changing any of your project files that trigger gulp file change.
`theme` is where your `highlight` syntax styles are kept, as well as the actuall `theme.css` generated by the styleguide
